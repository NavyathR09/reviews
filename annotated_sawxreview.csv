31,"I wasn't exactly happy getting into this, partly due to unrelated theater mishaps before the screening. Right before ""Saw X,"" I'd just come out of watching ""The Creator,"" where the theater staff had mistakenly played the wrong movie at the start; ended up watching the opening scene of ""Barbie"" before they finally corrected the mistake. People were pretty mad. And then during the previews and cinema ads for ""Saw X,"" I spotted a rat in the theater, which unnerved me to say the least. So, I wasn't in the best frame of mind to begin with. Startled me and left me feeling a bit annoyed. Throughout ""Saw X,"" especially during the slower scenes, I couldn't help but glance around and even lift my feet off the ground, wondering if the rat was still lurking nearby.Regarding the movie itself, I wasn't particularly excited about it, especially since I found the previous Saw movie ""Spiral"" so boring that I couldn't even finish it-a rare occurrence for me as I usually try to sit through any movie, whether I like it or not. But, I went to watch ""Saw X"" mainly for nostalgic reasons. I remembered how we used to spend hours discussing the various deaths in the series during my school days.As expected, ""Saw X"" delivers on the gruesome and gory front; anything less would have been a letdown. It's uncomfortable to watch, and that's all you need to know because has there ever been another reason to watch a ""Saw"" movie? Lol.John Kramer's back, albeit looking a bit older despite the movie's timeline. His morals are questionable but somewhat pure, though I wasn't as emotionally invested in his character. He designs these diabolical contraptions, so by no standard is he a good person. Instead, the movie introduces even worse characters so that we find ourselves rooting for John with a slightly clearer conscience. He's less of a hero and more of an antihero or judge.The movie does feel a bit drawn out, and I found myself impatiently waiting for it to get to the games. It felt like unnecessary filler. We know what we came to see, the director and writers know what we came to see, so let's get to business already!! Once the gruesome and bloody deaths kick in, it's all good. The in-between moments don't hold up as well, but the gruesome scenes compensate for that, a little. I did wish there were more victims than just the 4 the movie mainly focuses on; so other than Valentina it felt like the deaths were somewhat stretched out.So yeah, I don't think it's contending for best movie of the year, but definitely best deaths of the year. I didn't enjoy it as much as I remember doing when I was a kid. Definitely wished it was paced quicker. It's a mediocre movie with fantastic deaths that might be worth the watch if you're a fan of the franchise.",Neutral
32,"Granted my expectations weren't particularly high given the most recent additions to the world of Saw, but I was pleasantly surprised to find it was well above my expectations, possibly even being my favourite Saw movie yet. I had to knock off a star for some of the twists being just a little too predictable, and with a few scenes feeling a little anticlimactic, in particular the very end. Regardless of that definitely worth seeing, particularly on the big screen. Do yourself a favour though and avoid all trailers like the plague, I checked it out after watching the movie and it's one of the worst offenders of ruining the whole thing.",Positive
